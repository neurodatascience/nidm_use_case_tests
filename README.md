# NIDM use tests

This repo contains query tests against openNeuro data modeled in NIDM.
The purpose of these tests is to document the experience of a new user,
and to understand what use cases are currently easy, possible, and not possible.

The tests are organized roughly into four categories. 
They are queries about:

1. data modality
2. demographic information
3. clinical information
4. discovery and exploration of data

(for now), the tests are stored in a google colab notebook.
This [notebook can be accessed here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TPeJyfuYxLmURMYeC82qlo9DVOWzQXpC?usp=sharing).

There is also a spreadsheet overview of the (rough) test outcomes. 
This spreadsheet is (for now) stored in a google docs document [that can be accessed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PUu9CESM5QbXKe1j1lXSVridtVx99SVSWp7feQO2KLs/edit?usp=sharing).

## Use

1. Access the google collab notebook at [the shared link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TPeJyfuYxLmURMYeC82qlo9DVOWzQXpC?usp=sharing)
2. Make a copy of the notebook
3. Run the notebook against the hard-coded reprolake SPARQL endpoint to see the results
